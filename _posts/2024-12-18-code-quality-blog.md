## Code Quality Tools in Python

Our team is currently working on a legacy app which delivers fully automated front-to-back data quality, monitoring, and assurance of trade-level data with the help of machine learning algorithms. The current architecture of the app is unscalable, and the business requires us to widen the scope of the app by onboarding new risk management systems and expanding geographical coverage. We are therefore refactoring the code to meet business requirements and thus use code quality tools. This short post explains some popular Python code quality tools, what benefits they provide, and examples of use.

### What Do We Mean by Good Code Quality?

In short, it means meeting the project specification and requirements, but more generally, having readability, maintainability, and adherence to standards such as PEP8 for Python. PEP8 is a document that provides guidance on how to best write Python code.

The tools we are covering are:

1. **Pylint** - Simple code analysis  
2. **Black** - Code style formatting  
3. **Flake8** - Standard for Python

## Pylint

Pylint is a static code analyzer that doesn’t require you to actually run your code. It helps with bug detection and adherence to standards like PEP8. The main problem Pylint solves is bad “code smells,” meaning aspects of code that indicate potential errors, such as unused imports which are not ideal as they can cause naming conflicts and clutter your code.

### Example: Before Using Pylint

```python

import math
import random  # Unused import


def CircleArea(Radius):
    pi = math.pi  # Unused variable
    diameter = 2 * Radius  # Unused variable
    
    if Radius <= 0:
        print("Invalid radius!")  # Bad practice to print errors directly
        return None
    
    return 3.14159 * Radius * Radius
